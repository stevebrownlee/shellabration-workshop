2. Come with one of the following setup
	* Mac
	* Linux

3. Collaborative mindset - you will be working with teammates.

## Overview

The Shellabration workshop will celebrate the wonderous joys of the bash interactive environment. You will go on a brief history of kernels, shells, and terminal emulators. Then you will embark on a journey of discovery about using aliases, functions, and bash scripts to accelerate and automate common tasks you do in your terminal.

You will use some powerful tools you may not know exist.

* echo
* tail
* grep
* if
* curl
* case
* PS3 prompt

When we're done, you will have an interactive bash script that will automate the process of creating a git repository, connecting it with Github, and having the appropriate `.gitignore` file created for the project type.

## How to Run Your Script

Make the file executable first with the following command.

```sh
chmod +x hookup.sh
```

Then run it with the following command.

```sh
./hookup.sh
```
